# force_feedback_mpc
Optimal control toolbox to achieve force feedback control in MPC. It implements custom action models & other stuff based on the Crocoddyl library, in C++ and python with unittests and examples. In particular, it contains the core classes used in IROS22 (torque-feedback MPC based on low-pass filtering) and in (coming soon) soft contact based MPC (linear spring-damper).

# Dependencies
- Crocoddyl
